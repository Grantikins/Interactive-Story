                    You have been thrown in the castle's dungeon. A man comes down with a possy of soldiers at his back.
                    He is wearing armor and clothes similar to that of the man at the castle walls. His presence can be felt.
                    This man is feared, and he himself knows this. He walks straight up to the dungeon and says,
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I am the leader of this mercenary party. The man at the base of the castle walls was one of my few diplomats.
                    You are a valuable lord. Not only will I be paid for your army's defeat, but I will hold you and your family
                    for ransom. Do please stay alive down here, and don't try anything you'll regret."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before you can say anything, he quickly makes his exit. A single guard stays to stand watch over you. Your
                    family is here with you. You have to try something...
                </p>
